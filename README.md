## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt FLEXBOX and CSS GRID while solving the project task. I also was able to note the differnece when using position and float and when using flexbox.  

### Continued development
I would love to know more on how to use flexbox, css grid, float and position very well and looking forward to use all these in my next project

### Useful resources
